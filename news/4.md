# Landlock news #4

[*16 July 2024*](https://lore.kernel.org/landlock/20240716.yui4Iezai8ae@digikod.net/)

Here is the fourth Landlock newsletter!

## Articles and conferences

We wrote a [detailed article about Landlock](https://landlock.io/talks/2024-06-06_landlock-article.pdf)
explaining the underlying concepts, the implementation, and the community.
This was written for the [SSTIC conference](https://www.sstic.org/2024/presentation/landlock-design/).

I did a [workshop at the Pass the Salt conference](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/pts2024/talk/8FVYDF/) to explain how to
mitigate security vulnerabilities with Landlock (demonstrated with ImageMagick).
[Related materials](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/workshop-imagemagick)
are freely available to do it at home.

Arto Niemi published a ["Survey of Real-World Process Sandboxing"](https://fruct.org/publications/volume-35/fruct35/files/Niem.pdf)
at the Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT).
Their conclusion: "[...] we found Landlock and minijail [which uses
Landlock] to be relatively convenient from a developer perspective. In
general, process self-containment and process-wrapping seems to be an
order of magnitude easier to configure than MAC policies."

Researchers from University of Bergamo gave a talk at ASIA CCS
conference about [Cage4Deno: A Fine-Grained Sandbox for Deno Subprocesses](https://cs.unibg.it/seclab-papers/2023/ASIACCS/paper/cage4deno.pdf)
(leveraging Landlock).

They also gave a talk at the RAID conference about
[NatiSand: Native Code Sandboxing for JavaScript Runtimes](https://cs.unibg.it/seclab-papers/2023/RAID/natisand.pdf)
(leveraging Landlock).

Eric Leblond gave a talk (in French) at the SSTIC conference about
[sandboxing with Landlock to mitigate real world security issues](https://www.sstic.org/2023/presentation/attaque_supply_chain_suricata/).

Günther Noack will give a talk at LSS Europe about
[Landlock and the new IOCTL support](https://sched.co/1ebVW).

I'll give a talk at OSS Europe to better
[explain sandboxing with Landlock](https://sched.co/1ej3a).

## The XZ backdoor

XZ Utils is a widely used compression tool and library.  The main
maintainer implemented sandboxing with Landlock, and released a new
version 5.6.0 with this feature.  In March 2024, a backdoor was found
and reported.  It was introduced in February by a new maintainer who
earned this trust after more than two years of effort.

Among the malicious changes,
[the attacker disabled Landlock's support for XZ Utils](https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline)
and released a new version.

The [sabotaged configuration check has since been fixed with version 5.6.2](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/f9cf4c05edd1),
but this effort to stealthily disable sandboxing is a clear sign
that Landlock disturbs attackers.

## Merged kernel features

Linux 6.7 (Landlock ABI 4) supports initial network access control with
the `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP` and `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP`
rights thanks to Konstantin Meskhidze.  We can now control inbound and
outbound TCP connections according to the source or the destination
port.  This led to kernel code refactoring which opens the way to more
network protocol support.
See [user space documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#network-flags).

Linux 6.10 (Landlock ABI 5) supports IOCTL control with the new
`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV` right thanks to Günther Noack.  This
restriction only applies to IOCTL commands implemented by device drivers
(i.e. block or character devices).  As other file system access rights,
this can be used to only allow such IOCTL commands on a specified set of
file hierarchies per sandbox.
See [user space documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#filesystem-flags).

We also added a slight change in all supported kernels to inform system
administrators (with kernel logs) how they can configure the system to
support Landlock, if a process tried to sandbox itself on a kernel where
Landlock is disabled. New documentation will help
[enable Landlock on systems](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#kernel-support)
when it is not already the case.

Since Linux 6.3, we improved documentation and kselftests (user space
testing), and added support for KUnit (kernel testing).  Part of this
work led us to support the UML architecture to easily run application
tests in a CI against different kernel versions.  With this support we
can make sure that backward compatibility works fine for the tested
applications.  I encourage you to take a look at
[landlock-test-tools](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/landlock-test-tools) and the related
[GitHub CI configuration](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/rust-landlock/blob/c1fef294217cdef52f4102d76d1c5ece1b8e0cf6/.github/workflows/rust.yml#L166-L179).

## Roadmap and ongoing development

We created [GitHub issues](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues)
to track [ongoing and future work](https://github.com/orgs/landlock-lsm/projects/1).

Feel free to [reach out if you want to contribute](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/contribute)!

We also plan to improve the website with extended documentation and
examples.

## Kernel development highlights

Günther Noack is now an [official reviewer of Landlock](https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/5bf9e57e634b)!
After the IOCTL feature, he is now working on improving the
documentation, including man pages.

Mikhail Ivanov is working on socket type control.  This is an important
feature that will make it possible to create sandboxes without any
network access, except for an explicit list of allowed protocols.  This
will nicely complement the
[TCP port control](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/6)
(and future ones for other protocols).
He is also working on [controlling TCP listen calls](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/15).

Tahera Fahimi was selected as an Outreachy intern to work on
[IPC restrictions](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/7) (e.g. abstract unix socket,
[signals](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/8)) to better isolate a
Landlock domain.

I'm working on bringing [audit support](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/3) to Landlock.

## Landlock libraries

As explained by Günther Noack, the Go library now supports
[TCP](https://blog.gnoack.org/post/landlock-v4/) and
[IOCTL restrictions](https://blog.gnoack.org/post/landlock-ioctl/).

A [new version of the Rust crate](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/rust-landlock/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
was released, with support for TCP
control and some miscellaneous improvements.

Please update your dependencies and use the latest Landlock ABI version
for improved sandboxing.

We are also working on a [new minimal C library](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/38).
