The goal of Landlock is to enable restricting ambient rights (e.g. global
filesystem access) for a set of processes. Because Landlock is a stackable
LSM, it makes it possible to create safe security sandboxes as new security layers
in addition to the existing system-wide access controls. This kind of sandbox
is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or
unexpected/malicious behaviors in user space applications. Landlock empowers
any process, including unprivileged ones, to securely restrict themselves.
